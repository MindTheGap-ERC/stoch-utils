Utility functions for probability theory

## Description

This repo contains utility functions for stochastic simulations in R. Currently implemented are

* Wiener process
* Brownian drift
* Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
* Constant rate Poisson point process

## Future Work
Methods that will be implemented in the future:
* Drawing samples from distributions based on their pdfs (using rejection sampling)
* Varying rate Poisson point processes
* Thinning of point processes
* Basic noise models (all colors)
* Subordinators
